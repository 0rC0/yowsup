# id:		This field is used in registration calls (-r|-R|-e), and for login if you are trying to use an existing account which is setup 
#		on a physical device (--v1). Typically it should be the phone's IMEI if your account is setup on a Nokia or Android device, 
#		or the phone's WLAN's MAC Address for iOS devices. If you are not trying to use an existing account, you can leave this field 
#		blank or set it to some random text. Do not change this field after registering using Yowsup
